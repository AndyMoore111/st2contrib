# RSS Integration Pack

This pack contains integrations for RSS / Atom feeds.

## Sensors

### RSSSensor

This sensor periodically polls RSS / Atom feed for new entries and once a new
entry is detected, a trigger is emitted.

By default the sensor tries to filter out duplicated entries by using the entry
"published at" / "updated at" timestamp - a trigger is only emitted for entries
with a timestamp which is larger than the one we have last seen.

Keep in mind that this approach is not perfect and it's a compromise between
duplicated triggers and potentially missing some entries. Some blogs publish
new entries with a timestamp in the past - if timestamp based filtering is
enabled, those entries will be skipped / missed.

Supported feed standards:

* Atom 0.3
* Atom 1.0
* RSS 1.0
* RSS 2.0
* RSS 2.0 with namespaces
